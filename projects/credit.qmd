This project evaluated several credit scores in the lab and in the field WITH consumers. The scores we built to be accurate, fair and transparent.

This project is in cooperation with Germany's largest credit scoring agency. Due to NDA and ongoing developments, public announcements and pre-prints of the research is not to be expected before November 2025.

If you want to know more, shoot me an email and we can have a chat.
