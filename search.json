    "text": "Abstract: AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being employed in high-stakes decisions that impact both individuals and society at large, often without adequate safeguards to ensure safety, quality, and equity. Yet LLMs hallucinate, lack common sense, and are biased—shortcomings that may reflect LLMs’ inherent limitations and thus may not be remedied by more sophisticated architectures, more data, or more human feedback. Relying solely on LLMs for complex, high-stakes decisions is therefore problematic. Here, we present a hybrid collective intelligence system that mitigates these risks by leveraging the complementary strengths of human experience and the vast information processed by LLMs. We apply our method to open-ended medical diagnostics, combining 40,762 differential diagnoses made by physicians with the diagnoses of five state-of-the art LLMs across 2,133 text-based medical case vignettes. We show that hybrid collectives of physicians and LLMs outperform both single physicians and physician collectives, as well as single LLMs and LLM ensembles. This result holds across a range of medical specialties and professional experience and can be attributed to humans’ and LLMs’ complementary contributions that lead to different kinds of errors. Our approach highlights the potential for collective human and machine intelligence to improve accuracy in complex, open-ended domains like medical diagnostics.\nPAPER\nPREPRINT"

    "text": "HYBRID INTELLIGENCE   |  HUMAN-AI ORGANIZATIONS   |   DECISION SUPPORT   |   ML\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\nWelcome!\nI work on improving the decision making of individuals, crowds and hybrid human-AI systems. I combine decision making research from psychology and economics with the latest insights from computer science. You can find my projects here.\nI am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Adaptive Rationality, Max Planck Institute for Human Development and fellow of the Joachim Herz Foundation.\nMy PhD was funded by the Foundation of German Business (Stiftung der deutschen Wirtschaft). I have received further funding by the Danish Data Science Adacemy and the Joachim Herz Foundation.\n\n\nIndustry\nI also work as a consultant and ML engineer. Here, my focus is on the development of interpretable machine learning models that are accurate, fair and transparent. To that end, I employ a wide suite of model architectures and engage in extensive feature engineering and multi-parameter optimization. It is good fun. In my industry work I often join forces with Simply Rational.\n\n\nLatest updates\n\n[07/25] Submitted my dissertation. Pre-prints are available, just reach out!\n[06/25] Our paper on how to ensemble humans and LLMs for accurate medical diagnoses is out in PNAS!\n[04/25] Our paper on how to use interpretable machine learning models in football was accepted in Science and Medicine in Football.\n[09/24] Our work on LLMs and collective intelligence was published in Nature Human Behavior.\n[09/24] I was awarded a fellowship for interdisciplinary economics by the Joachim Herz Foundation for my work on improving consumers’ ability understand and make changes to their credit scores.\n[07/24] I presented my work on human-AI ensembling for efficient crowd wisdom at Advances in Decision Analysis 2024 Check out the project here.\n[06/24] We uploaded our pre-print on human-LLM ensembles and how their complementary strength improve open-ended differential diagnoses. Read it here.\n[04/24] I visited Odense and Copenhagen thanks to a grant by the Danish Data Science Adacemy to work on human-AI ensembling.",
