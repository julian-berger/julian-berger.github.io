#### Research

Welcome!

I work on improving the decision making of individuals, crowds and hybrid human-AI systems. I combine decision making research from psychology and economics with the latest insights from computer science. [You can find my projects here.](projects/index.qmd)

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Adaptive Rationality, Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/adaptive-rationality) and fellow of the Joachim Herz Foundation.

My PhD was funded by the [Foundation of German Business (Stiftung der deutschen Wirtschaft)](https://www.sdw.org/index.html). I have received further funding by the [Danish Data Science Adacemy](https://ddsa.dk/) and the [Joachim Herz Foundation](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en/research/promotion-of-young-talents/add-on-fellowships-for-interdisciplinary-economics).


#### Industry

I also work as a consultant and ML engineer. Here, my focus is on the development of interpretable machine learning models that are accurate, fair and transparent. To that end, I employ a wide suite of model architectures and engage in extensive feature engineering and multi-parameter optimization. It is good fun. In my industry work I often join forces with [Simply Rational](https://www.simplyrational.de/en/). 

#### Latest updates

-   \[07/25\] Submitted my dissertation. Pre-prints are available, just reach out! 

-   \[06/25\] Our [paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2426153122) on how to ensemble humans and LLMs for accurate medical diagnoses is out in PNAS! 

-   \[04/25\] Our [paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24733938.2025.2517056) on how to use interpretable machine learning models in football was accepted in Science and Medicine in Football. 

-   \[09/24\] Our work on LLMs and collective intelligence was published in [Nature Human Behavior](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01959-9).

-   \[09/24\] I was awarded a fellowship for interdisciplinary economics by the [Joachim Herz Foundation](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en/research/promotion-of-young-talents/add-on-fellowships-for-interdisciplinary-economics) for my work on improving consumers' ability understand and make changes to their credit scores.

-   \[07/24\] I presented my work on human-AI ensembling for efficient crowd wisdom at Advances in Decision Analysis 2024 [Check out the project here](projects/hct.qmd).

-   \[06/24\] We uploaded our pre-print on human-LLM ensembles and how their complementary strength improve open-ended differential diagnoses. [Read it here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14981)

-   \[04/24\] I visited Odense and Copenhagen thanks to a grant by the [Danish Data Science Adacemy](https://ddsa.dk/) to work on human-AI ensembling.
